The RSCVD initiative is made available by the [IFLA Document Delivery and Resource Sharing Standing Committee](https://www.ifla.org/docdel) and generous help of volunteers around the world. In particular, Joe McArthur and the [Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org) have provided valuable supports on creating the web page and the request form. The Open Access Button allows librarians to find materials they are looking for even without making the request.

We sincerely appreciate volunteers for their time and expertise. If you wish to join in volunteering for the initiative, please contact [ifladdrs@gmail.com](mailto:ifladdrs@gmail.com). As the number of requests grows every hour, we need your help more than ever.

Below is the list of volunteers as of April 27th, 2020. And the [IFLA DDRS Standing Committee members](https://www.ifla.org/standing-committee/15) are also providing their expertise for starting and promoting the initiative and subsequently their resources for providing the materials requested.
